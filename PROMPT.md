**CRITICAL:** When creating or updating files (markdown, JSON, or any code), ALWAYS use a **code artifact** with appropriate language tag (application/vnd.ant.code with language="markdown", "json", etc.), NOT a document artifact. The code artifact must appear in the sidebar as a persistent artifact. The user needs to copy raw code, not a rendered preview. If the content appears as formatted/styled text instead of a code block in the sidebar, regenerate it as a code artifact.
