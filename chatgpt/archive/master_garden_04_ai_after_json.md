This message establishes the authoritative context for this Plant Channel.

Use the Master Garden Assistant Guide and the Initial Plant Data JSON above as the canonical workflow and schema reference.

Keep Plant Main Data in context. Use all attributes from `id` through `timeline` provided in the Initial Plant Data JSON at the beginning of this thread as authoritative. Scale all watering/fertilizer/amendment/spray instructions to the container size without asking me.

Do NOT perform an assessment, generate a Daily Journal Entry, or review Plant Main Data yet.

Confirm the Plant Main Data attributes (I will ask you to keep this in context with every new-day message) and then wait for the first new-day message that includes weather, probe readings, and photos.
