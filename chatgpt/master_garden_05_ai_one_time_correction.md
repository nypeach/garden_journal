Apply this going forward in this Plant Channel. Do not save it to memory.

I take probe readings whenever I am able, but I will not take another reading later the same day.
When I send probe readings, photos, and weather, that is my final data set for the day.

You must:
- Treat the probe reading timestamp as the time for the Daily Journal Entry (use the earliest valid probe if multiple are provided)
- Use the current time ONLY to reason about watering decisions and expected moisture loss
- Assume I will not provide additional readings later today

You must still perform your **full Expert Horticulturist Assessment** exactly as you normally would.
Do not narrow the assessment scope or treat watering as a partial or standalone task.

When evaluating watering, account for:
- the probe moisture reading and its timestamp
- elapsed time since the reading
- today’s weather, tonight’s conditions, and tomorrow’s forecast
- my location in Loxahatchee, FL
- this plant’s behavior
- sun exposure using:
  - `full_sun_start`
  - `full_shade_start`

Your watering recommendation must be ONE of the following:
- **Water now**
- **Water first thing in the morning**
- **Do not water until the next probe reading**

If watering is recommended, you must also state **how much**, using a hose-first approach:
- light surface wetting
- moderate watering (approximate seconds/minutes)
- or deep, slow watering with soak guidance

Do not advise “check again later” or defer the decision.

Acknowledge this correction with one brief sentence and confirm you will follow it going forward. Do not re-run, revise, or regenerate any assessment or JSON already completed. Apply this correction starting with the next new day (weather, probe readings, photos), and continue the workflow normally from that point.
