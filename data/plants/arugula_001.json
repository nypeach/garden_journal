  "whats_been_logged": "This arugula planting has progressed from reseeded recovery into a successful first baby-leaf harvest and is now rebuilding a dense regrowth canopy from intact crowns. Over time, soil moisture has been the main variable, with intentional dry-down and occasional saturation periods monitored to prevent root stress while supporting steady leaf rebound. Leaf posture, canopy thickness, and color have remained strong overall, keeping the planting on track for repeat cut-and-come harvests.",
  "current_stage": "Post-Harvest Regrowth (Cut-And-Come Phase)",
  "current_state": "The arugula is actively regrowing after its first baby-leaf harvest, producing a dense, vigorous canopy of upright new leaves from intact crowns. Leaf color and posture are strong with no visible wilt, spotting spread, or pest damage. The root zone is currently very wet, so the planting is being allowed to dry down to maintain healthy oxygen levels and prevent saturation stress.",
