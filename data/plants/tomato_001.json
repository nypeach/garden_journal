  "whats_been_logged": "The plant has been progressing from early flowering into heavy fruit set while repeatedly balancing soil moisture and foliar health. Initial leaf-spot on older foliage was managed with selective pruning, but renewed spotting on mid-canopy leaves led to more extensive sanitation pruning and a temporary thinning of the canopy. Persistent probe and moisture issues traced to a compacted topsoil/sand layer were corrected on Dec 9, 2025 by replacing the upper root zone with potting mix, and current tracking focuses on canopy regrowth, disease recovery, and stable fruit development under improved soil conditions.",

  "current_state": "The plant is in active fruit set with multiple well-formed green clusters while recovering from significant foliar spotting and recent sanitation pruning. Lower and mid-canopy leaves with advanced lesions were removed, leaving a temporarily open lower stem and a concentrated upper canopy of healthy foliage and flowers. New growth at the top remains vigorous and well hydrated, and with improved soil aeration and moisture distribution the plant is poised to rebuild a fuller canopy while continuing to size fruit.",
