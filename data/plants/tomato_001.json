  "whats_been_logged": "The focus has been on guiding the plant through heavy fruit set into active ripening while keeping soil moisture stable under full sun and very low humidity. Earlier leaf-spot pressure was managed with sanitation pruning and improved airflow, and current tracking emphasizes harvest timing, tie/support adjustments as fruit weight increases, and light 4-5-5 feeding to sustain continued flowering and fruit fill without stressing the root zone.",

  "current_state": "The plant is tall, vigorous, and heavily loaded with fruit clusters across the canopy, with multiple tomatoes now progressing through blush and orange stages and several fully red fruits ready for harvest. Foliage remains a healthy green and productive, and the main stems are upright and well supported by stakes despite increasing fruit weight. Ongoing flowering and active fruit fill continue simultaneously, making consistent moisture and support tie management essential to prevent stress during peak ripening.",
