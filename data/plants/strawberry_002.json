Reviewed whether to remove questionable flower/fruit in tight clusters: advised leaving any firm, pale developing berries and only removing fruit that becomes soft, collapses, or darkens early. For mixed flower clusters with one spent/aborted bloom, advised you can remove only the clearly dead bloom to reduce mold risk while leaving adjacent healthy buds/flowers. Confirmed spinosad (Dead Bug) is appropriate for chewing pests; aim coverage to upper/lower leaf surfaces and avoid directly saturating open flowers when possible (light incidental contact is generally fine, but minimize).",
