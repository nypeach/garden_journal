      "observations": "The plant looks very weak, with sparse, pale foliage and some leaves that fall off with a light touch. Several stems are bare with only small leaves at the tips or lower nodes. Soil moisture has dropped into the mid-30s, showing that the root zone is beginning to dry out, and pH has moved back into a more comfortable slightly acidic to neutral range. Fertility is low, which is acceptable while the plant carries minimal foliage.",
      "actions": "Give a light, careful watering to rehydrate the root zone without saturating it, focusing on moistening the top 2-3 inches rather than flooding the pot. Keep the plant in bright shade or gentle morning sun only to reduce stress. Do not fertilize and avoid any further pH adjustments.",
      "next_steps": "Recheck moisture in roughly 24 hours and monitor for any signs of new leaf emergence at the lower nodes. If stems begin to brown and dry all the way to the base, those specific stems may not recover and can be removed later. Continue avoiding fertilizer until clear, vigorous new growth appears.",
      "q_and_a_summary": "Addressed concern that the plant might be failing and explained that severe pruning plus earlier pH swings can cause dramatic temporary decline, but firm, greenish stem bases still support regrowth.

No signs of pests are visible.",
      "actions": "Do not apply lime or any additional pH adjusters. No fertilizer today. Avoid watering until the moisture level falls further, as roots are still recovering.

If foliage continues to yellow heavily, be prepared for some stems to die back while the plant consolidates energy.",
      "q_and_a_summary": "Clarified whether lime should be applied now that pH has risen and advised against it because the earlier baking-soda drench has already pushed pH high.

The plant appears stressed from the combination of heavy pruning and recent pH and moisture swings, but the lower nodes remain intact.",
