Probe readings documented pH correction efforts using lime, moisture stability across the zone, and continued expansion of the seedling mat.",

  "current_state": "Thyme plants show healthy vegetative growth with multiple true leaves, upright stems, and expanding lateral spread across the zone. Foliage is evenly green with no visible spotting, wilting, or burn. The crown areas appear clean and stable, and the plants are well anchored despite recent wet soil conditions.",
