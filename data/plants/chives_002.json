  "whats_been_logged": "The chives progressed from initial germination into early post-emergence development, with thin green shoots breaking the soil surface and reappearing after intermittent burial from wind and rain. While emergence has been uneven and sparse due to surface disturbance, surviving seedlings remain green and upright, indicating continued viability as roots establish in the shared window box.",

Only a few short green tips are visible above the surface after gentle brushing, while others remain covered. Color remains healthy with no collapse, yellowing, or damping-off, indicating the seedlings are alive and anchored despite limited visible top growth.",

Only a few very short green blades remain visible above the soil surface. Remaining blades retain healthy green color with no yellowing, collapse, or damping-off observed. Surface soil appears dry and lightly crusted despite moderate moisture earlier in the morning, consistent with top-layer drying in a shallow window box.",

Assessment confirmed significant stress from repeated burial and surface drying but noted remaining viable green blades. Watering was recommended immediately due to elapsed time since the morning probe reading, full sun exposure, and seedling root depth.",
