      "actions": "Leave the exposed slow-release pellets in place. Do not fertilize today, as nutrient levels remain adequate. Avoid further soil disturbance to allow roots to settle from the deep loosening. Do not water, since moisture is ideal and conditions are humid with rain likely.",

The remaining foliage is soft but viable, and stems appear healthy with no signs of rot.

Soil pH is highly alkaline at 8.39, which may limit nutrient uptake.",
      "actions": "Gently loosen the top half inch of soil to break the dense root crust and improve air and water movement.
