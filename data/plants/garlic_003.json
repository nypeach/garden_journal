Soil is fully saturated from recent watering, causing darker coloration and the elevated moisture reading. The extremely high pH reading of 10.17 is almost certainly a probe anomaly caused by contact with a lime pocket or oversaturated soil, as the plant shows no symptoms consistent with alkaline stress. Salt, EC, and fertility values are elevated due to recent water dissolving surface lime and minerals into solution, but remain non-harmful. Overall plant health remains excellent.",
