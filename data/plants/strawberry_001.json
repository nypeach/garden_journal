  "whats_been_logged": "The plant has moved from early bud formation into steady flowering and reliable fruit development. Older foliage showed isolated leaf-spot that remained contained after selective pruning, while new growth has stayed clean and vigorous. Improvements to soil structure after repotting have supported more even moisture and stronger root aeration, allowing the plant to maintain stable foliage and continually produce healthy blossoms and berries.",

  "current_state": "The plant is an established container-grown strawberry in active flowering and early fruiting. It shows strong new growth, good moisture balance, and healthy developing berries. Minor leaf-spot remains confined to older leaves with no active spreading, and the plant is recovering well from earlier alkaline soil issues.",

Recheck pH and moisture with probe following morning to see how new potting mix has shifted conditions. Do not fertilize yet until plant shows stable new growth in refreshed soil.",
