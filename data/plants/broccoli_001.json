    "Broccoli seedlings started in tray, surrounded by chive planting zones.",

    "Added potting mix on top of sand-heavy layer for better moisture and pH balance."
  ],
  "whats_been_logged": "The broccoli planting began in a shallow, sand-heavy tray with poor moisture retention and alkaline pH. Pale but stable seedlings gradually improved as richer potting mix was added and pH corrections were applied. Moisture retention strengthened and pH swung from alkaline to acidic before stabilizing near ideal range. Foliage color and structure have steadily improved with consistent light and moisture as the seedlings thicken their stems and develop multiple true leaves.",
  "current_stage": "Seedling – true leaves expanding",
  "current_state": "Seedlings are in a stable seedling phase with multiple true leaves unfolding and color improving toward a healthy light green. Moisture and pH are now within an acceptable range, and the plants are responding well to full sun in the window planter. They are not yet transplant-ready but are progressing toward thicker stems and a sturdier root system.",
