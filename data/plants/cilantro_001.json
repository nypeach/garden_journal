Early stress from dryness and high alkalinity resolved as pH stabilized and seedlings showed consistent upright growth. Fertility remains modest but adequate for early stages, and leaf color has steadily improved. The plant has responded reliably to adjustments and is progressing toward fuller true-leaf development.",
