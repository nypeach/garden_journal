  "whats_been_logged": "The plant moved through its early pre-germination phase with several soil challenges that required correction. Initial dryness, alkalinity, and later acidity were stabilized through careful pH adjustments and controlled watering. A temporary setback occurred when the soil became oversaturated and surface lime washed away, but moisture and chemistry were gradually brought back into balance. The bed now holds consistent warmth, improved fertility, and conditions that support reliable germination.",

Growth is upright and vigorous with healthy coloration, and there are no signs of damping-off or stress. Despite the soil being oversaturated, the plants remain stable and continue to develop normally.",
