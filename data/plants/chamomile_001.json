  ],
  "whats_been_logged": "The planting began in dry, lean soil along the planter edges with initially poor germination conditions. Once soil moisture was stabilized, the first seedlings emerged where surface light and airflow were strongest, forming a fine mat of bright green cotyledons. Soil acidity was corrected with dolomitic lime, supporting continued sprouting and healthier early development. Sprouts have remained upright, evenly colored, and free of damping-off, showing steady expansion as moisture and pH consistency improved.",
  "current_stage": "Full Feathery Leaf Clusters",
  "current_state": "The chamomile displays dense, healthy feathery foliage with strong lateral spread and compact growth. Multiple clusters are well established with bright green coloration, stable crowns, and no visible signs of stress, disease, or discoloration. Growth is uniform and transitioning toward early canopy formation.",
