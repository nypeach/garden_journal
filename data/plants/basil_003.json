  "whats_been_logged": "The focus has shifted from early vegetative expansion into managing canopy size through topping, monitoring basil regrowth response, and protecting the shared herb window box from cutworm activity. Soil moisture, EC, and salt levels have become the main variables to watch, with attention on correcting uneven wet pockets and preventing root-zone stress while the basil branches back out.",
  "current_stage": "Post-Harvest Branching Regrowth",
  "current_state": "The Thai basil has been recently topped to reduce crowding and encourage branching, leaving multiple healthy stems and nodes positioned for regrowth. Remaining foliage is evenly green with no visible spotting or scorch, and the plant appears stable and upright in the shared herb window box. Soil conditions are currently very moist with uneven nutrient and salt distribution across zones, requiring dry-down to protect root oxygenation, and cutworm pressure has been confirmed and treated.",
