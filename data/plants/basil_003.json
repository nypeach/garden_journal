Early germination was slow but steady as moisture stabilized and pH gradually shifted from alkaline to acidic, then naturally rebounded toward ideal range. Sprouts emerged healthy and upright, with first true-leaf tips now visible as the seedlings transition from germination into active early growth.",

  "current_state": "A healthy stand of Thai basil with upright stems and multiple sets of elongated true leaves actively expanding. Foliage is evenly green with no visible stress, wilting, or pest damage, and the soil is uniformly moist with good structure in the shared herb planter.",
